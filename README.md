PROJECT TITLE 6:  RideSmart PH: Motorcycle Maintenance for Sustainability


PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 
RideSmart PH is a web application that empowers motorcycle owners to practice sustainable and responsible vehicle maintenance. Recognizing that well-maintained motorcycles emit fewer pollutants and consume fuel more efficiently, the platform allows users to log and monitor their motorcycleâ€™s maintenance schedules, such as oil changes, air filter replacements, tire checks, and brake inspections.

The application features a personalized maintenance dashboard for each registered vehicle, offering automatic reminders for upcoming tasks, historical maintenance logs, and cost tracking. Additionally, it provides educational content on eco-friendly motorcycle practices, including fuel-saving tips, green product recommendations, and local mechanic directories that promote sustainable services.

Aligned with SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), RideSmart PH promotes a culture of preventive maintenance to reduce environmental harm and increase vehicle lifespan, encouraging riders to contribute to a cleaner, more efficient future on the road.

TARGET USERS: Motorcycle owners, delivery riders, ride-hailing drivers, and environmentally conscious vehicle users who want to maintain their motorcycles efficiently while reducing their carbon footprint.
